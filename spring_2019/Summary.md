Throughout my first semester of RCOS, I learned a lot. I went into this project without having experience in team development, and figured out the basics of many technologies.  
The first technology I had to learn was Python.  I used Python to call PostgreSQL commands from a script, and load API data in from AlphaVantage.  This required connecting to the database and sending commands, and was quite challenging as I had to figure out everything I encountered. I worked on calculating some metrics that brokers use to make decisions, and used these values to graph on the website.  I also learned to plot data in Python which we ended up using to plot our EOD data on the Hedgehogs site.  
I also learned Git which was used to manage our project on GitHub.  I had many merge/pull issues when combining code, and was set back by accidently merging the wrong side.  
Lastly, I learned to basic HTML and CSS.  I found this quite interesting given I only have worked in backend before.  It was challenging to figure out how to link the website to functions I had written, and what to call.

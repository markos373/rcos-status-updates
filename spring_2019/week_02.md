## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This past week, I began learning Python in order to scrape EOD financial data.  I also am learning PostgreSQL 
alongside so that I can grab records and organize information in tables.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I hope to finish the scraper by the end of this week and put it all into tables.
I am not sure what our next task will be, but when I finish the scraper I will receive one from my mentor.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I've had lots of trouble figuring out API usage and deciding on a reliable, free source.  
I haven't worked with these before so it takes me a while to get things working.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

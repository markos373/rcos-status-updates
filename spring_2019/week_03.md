## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I experimented with inserting data into PostgreSQL from Python.  I have successfully created a table through the script, but
am working on trying to export all of the data into tables in the databse.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on finishing the scraper this coming week.  After, I will need to find out what data I need and how to format it.  This has been a challenge with importing data from my Python script.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I am having trouble communicating commands to PostgreSQL from Python.  Commands do not seem to do what I expect it to do, so some testing will need to be done to find out what exactly is wrong.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I worked some more on the scraper.  I was finally able to achieve the desired functionality so now the data now successfully places into the PostgreSQL.  My next task is to find out how to use the data and display it in a usable way.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on finding out what to do with the data I have scraped, which I believe
will be creating functions to analyze the data for output to the website.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I have mostly resolved my previous blockers, but I am sure I will encounter more this coming week.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

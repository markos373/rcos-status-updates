## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This past week I attempted to add the S&P 500 to the database.  I wrote the script to grab the tickers, but still must figure out why my scraper won't work for certain companies.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan to fix the scraper so that it works and can import all the S&P data with my ticker list that I grabbed with get_sp500.py.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

My current blocker is figuring out why the scraper does not work for certain symbols.  I tested it with a few companies and it works, but it seems to just get stuck on some companies with seemingly no error message.

## Notes

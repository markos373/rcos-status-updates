## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I fixed the scraper so that it now can load data into the SQL table.  I am around half way
done with importing all 500 companies.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan to finish importing all the companies, then begin analyzing the data and
writing algorithms to provide easier metrics to make decisions on.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

My current blocker is that my scraper seemingly stops for no reason on certain tickers,
so when I run the scraper again, it works fine.  I have no idea what to do.  This requires
me to restart the program frequently when it halts.
## Notes

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I finished importing all the companies from the S&P 500, and am now working to use my partner's dataDriver to create a candlestick graph of the stock data.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on finishing the candlestick graph, and hopefully adding more visuals for the data analysis, such as SMA and other calculations my partner has made.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I am a bit stuck on getting modules to work as intended.  I have lots of import issues with my graphing modules that I am using (pandas, matplotlib).  I need to find out how to get them working with basic data first.
## Notes

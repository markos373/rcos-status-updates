## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I have produced simple graphs using matplotlib and added effects to make it look more user friendly.  I also added documentation to my Scraper and am going to frequently write more documentation as I did not previously.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on expanding my graphs and adding trend lines, and if time permits, displaying of points
upon hovering over.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I am still stuck on getting modules to work as intended.  Lots of import issues keep arising which cause me to spend hours fixing setup rather than working on code.
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

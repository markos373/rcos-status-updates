## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I began working on the actual website.  We met with our mentor on Saturday for a while and he gave us new features to be focusing on.  I am writing html now to link to our Python scripts 
which will allow lookup of tickers and displaying of graphs, but I have not figured this out yet.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on working more on the HTML of the website to tidy it up.  I do not have much experience so I am extremely slow in building the page and understanding how things should link to each other.  My
goal is the implement the search stock feature on the website to allow users to search a ticker and have a graph displayed.  
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I am a bit stuck on getting HTML to work as intended.  I have never worked in it so it is a steep learning experience.
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

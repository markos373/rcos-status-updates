## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I worked more on the search stock feature of the website and added a dropdown menu with options.  This took a while as I am an HTML noob still but I was proud when it worked.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on finishing the search stock feature, as I was waiting on a group member to finish his part of getting the graph to display on call, since I am working on the actual page.  I also plan on working on our presentation.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I still suck with HTML.  It takes me a while to understand how to transfer features found online into the project.
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

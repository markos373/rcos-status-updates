## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I modified our DataProcessingDriver to accept arguments.  It was a static call before, but this change allowed us to get our demonstration working which was able to
pull data from the database, graph it, and display it.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I plan on working on adding more complexity to the graphs, as I had previously but then 
received another task that was more urgent.  I want to add SMA and more information
onto the current graphs.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

We just finished the demonstration on time, but it works well and we have not started on new features yet.
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

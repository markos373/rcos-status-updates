## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This past week, I began learning to use HTTP requests to access Gmail emails.  The plan is to scrape email contents, so I need to figure out how to use Google Authentication to get access.
I am also learning to use Visual Studio, which has a cool GUI creating tool.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Next week, I hope to have the source code of emails to parse.  I think it will be tricky as I have not worked with requests and C# before.  With the source code, I will start figuring out how to extract unsubscribe links from the html source.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I'm having lots of trouble using the gmail authentication.  It will be difficult to learn.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

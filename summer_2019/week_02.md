## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I got access to the source code of emails to parse.  I also created a regex statement to find
unsubscribe buttons in the html source.  It does not work completely, so my partner and I are brainstorming on how to make it work with a wider range of emails.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Next week, I hope to have figured out how to identify where the unsubscribe buttons in the HTML source are.  This will not be easy; I will not be surprised if we do not figure this out this week because it is one of our bulk features.  If we do get this done, I want to work on integration between the front end and back.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I'm having trouble using regex to match a desired string.  I think I can figure it out though
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
